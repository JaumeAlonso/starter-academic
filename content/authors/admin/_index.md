I am a postdoctoral researcher in Mathematics. My research lies in the area of **dynamical systems** and **integrability** and focuses on the classification of semitoric and discrete integrable systems. At the moment I am working in the **Mathematical Physics and Geometry** group of the Technical University of Berlin, under the mentoring of [Prof. Suris](http://page.math.tu-berlin.de/~suris/). 

This semester I am also responsible, together with [Felix Schröder](http://page.math.tu-berlin.de/~fschroed/), for the exercise sessions of *Mathematik für PhysikerInnen I.*
